# Agile Frameworks

Agile is an umbrella for various frameworks that cater to different project needs. Each framework emphasizes certain aspects, such as stakeholder involvement or quick delivery of functional items. Understanding each framework's key concepts helps in selecting the most suitable one for a project.

## 1. **Scrum**
Focuses on delivering work in short, repeatable cycles (sprints) with specific roles like the **Scrum Master**, **Product Owner**, and **Development Team**. Scrum is the most widely used Agile framework and emphasizes structure and clear roles.
   - **Best Fit**: Medium-sized projects with a core team (7–9 members) working on complex tasks where requirements are open to change, but the overall vision remains fixed.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Team Roles**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers, Testers, Business Analysts.
     - **Collaboration**: Daily stand-ups and sprint reviews help facilitate communication and address impediments.
     - **Work Management**: Product backlog prioritized by value ensures that the most essential items are tackled first.
     - **Delivery**: Short sprints (2–4 weeks) focus on completing high-priority items.

## 2. **Kanban**
Emphasizes visualizing workflows and limiting work in progress to enhance efficiency. Teams pull work from a Kanban board and focus on optimizing workflow and reducing bottlenecks rather than working in sprints.
   - **Best Fit**: Projects needing strong workflow management rather than high collaboration.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Visual Workflow**: Uses a Kanban board to track tasks through stages (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
     - **Collaboration**: Teams often adopt Scrum-like practices, even though daily meetings aren’t mandated.
     - **Work Management**: Limits work-in-progress items per stage, ensuring a steady flow.
     - **Delivery**: Prioritization and tracking cycle times promote early and frequent delivery.

## 3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**
Prioritizes technical excellence and continuous improvement through practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and frequent releases.
   - **Best Fit**: Small, technical teams with close customer involvement.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Core Principles**: Communication, feedback, respect, courage, and simplicity.
     - **Collaboration**: Encourages pair programming for higher code quality.
     - **Work Management**: Welcomes changes and focuses on developing only the simplest solution that works.
     - **Delivery**: Delivers software in small releases with continuous integration and customer testing.

## 4. **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**
   - **Best Fit**: Large, complex projects that require structured planning.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Process**: Divides project into features, planned and designed individually.
     - **Collaboration**: Defined roles and responsibilities, with less shared accountability than in other frameworks.
     - **Work Management**: Iterative approach allows for customer feedback, even with a structured plan.
     - **Delivery**: Frequent and valuable software releases based on user-centered features.

## 5. **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
   - **Best Fit**: Projects that require a whole-project approach, including pre- and post-development stages.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Principles**: Emphasizes business needs, collaboration, quality, incremental development, and continuous communication.

     - **Work Management**: Iterative and incremental development allows for ongoing reassessment and adaptation.
     - **Delivery**: Time-boxed approach focuses on delivering value to the customer on time.
    
## 6. Lean Development
Focuses on eliminating waste, improving processes, and ensuring that every aspect of the project adds value to the customer.

   - **Core Principles**: Eliminate Waste, Build Quality In, Create Knowledge, Defer Commitment, Deliver Fast, Respect People, and Optimize the Whole
   - **Development Practices**: Value Stream Mapping, Just-in-Time Development, Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD), Root Cause Analysis, and Cross-Functional Teams
   - **Types of Waste**: Overproduction, Waiting, Transportation, Overprocessing, Inventory, Motion, and Defects
