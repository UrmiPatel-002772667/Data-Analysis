## Development Team
In a Scrum Team, **Developers** and **QA Testers** collaborate closely to deliver a **potentially releasable Increment** of the product that meets the "Definition of Done" by the end of each sprint. Their key responsibilities and characteristics include:

1. **Commitment to Sprint Goals**: The Development Team, including both developers and QA Testers, works together to commit to delivering a complete Increment within the sprint.
2. **Collaboration with the Business Analyst (BA)**:
   - The BA provides the Development Team with a detailed understanding of each user story, acceptance criteria, and the business context behind the requirements.
   - To ensure product quality, the BA and QA Tester collaborate on creating test cases that reflect business needs, keeping quality standards high throughout product development.
3. **Responsibilities**:
   - **Delivering a "Done" Product Increment**: The team’s main objective each sprint is to create a potentially shippable Increment that aligns with the product's "Definition of Done."
   - **Increment Creation**: Only Development Team members are involved in creating the Increment, ensuring clear focus and accountability.
4. **Characteristics of the Development Team**:
   - **Self-Organizing**: The team autonomously decides how to best convert Product Backlog items into product Increments.
   - **Cross-Functional**: Each team member brings a unique skill set, allowing the team to handle all aspects of creating the product Increment without relying on external resources.
   - **No Titles or Sub-Teams**: Scrum does not assign titles or recognize sub-teams within the Development Team, maintaining a unified structure where all members share equal accountability.
   - **Shared Accountability**: The entire Development Team, despite any individual specializations, is collectively responsible for the final Increment’s quality and readiness.


# Sprint 
- A time-boxed period of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
- Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort.
- A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.   

## Sprint Rules:
* **No changes to Sprint Goal:** No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
* **Quality goals:** Quality goals do not decrease.
* **Scope clarification:** Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

## Sprint as a Project:
* Each Sprint can be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon.
* Like projects, Sprints have a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan, the work, and the resultant product Increment.

## Sprint Benefits:
* **Predictability:** Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Sprints limit risk to one calendar month of cost.

### Sprint Planning

1. **Determining Sprint Scope and Sprint Goal**:
   - **Functionality Forecast**: The Development Team collaborates to forecast the functionality they will build, assessing which Product Backlog items are feasible within the sprint.
   - **Sprint Goal Discussion**: The Product Owner (PO) presents the overall goal for the sprint, which includes a target feature or improvement (e.g., customer login functionality). The PO shares high-priority items to achieve this goal, and the Business Analyst (BA) supports by adding relevant details and answering questions. The entire Scrum Team aligns on a clear Sprint Goal that offers guidance on why the Increment is valuable.
   - **Team Autonomy**: Only the Development Team can decide which items they can complete, based on capacity and past performance, fostering autonomy and realistic forecasting.

2. **Inputs to Sprint Planning**:
   - Key resources inform the team’s Sprint Planning process, including the **Product Backlog**, the **latest Increment**, the **Development Team's projected capacity**, and **past performance**. These elements help the team set a practical scope and Sprint Goal.

3. **Selecting Stories and Sprint Goal Setting**:
   - The PO explains high-priority items, discussing their business value, while the Scrum Master facilitates the discussion to ensure alignment with the Sprint Goal. Once aligned, the team selects specific Product Backlog items that best support the goal, creating a focused and achievable Sprint Backlog.

4. **Estimation Process**:
     - **High-Level Estimation (T-Shirt Sizing)**: Conducted during the creation of user stories, providing an early understanding of story complexity.
     - **Refinement Stage Estimation (Story Points)**: The PO, BA, and Development Team analyze the complexity, effort, and risk of each item in detail.
     - **Sprint Planning Estimation (Planning Poker)**: The team finalizes their estimate of each story and task during Sprint Planning, using techniques like Planning Poker to reach consensus.

5. **Committing to Stories Based on Team Capacity**:
   - The team reviews their capacity (in hours or story points) and commits to completing a manageable number of items within the sprint. This commitment is based on both estimated effort and available capacity, ensuring realistic workload distribution.

6. **Creating the Sprint Backlog**:
   - The selected stories move into the **To-Do** column on the Kanban board, providing a visual representation of the sprint scope:
     - **To-Do**: All stories aligned with the Sprint Goal are listed with their Story Points, making the backlog visible to the team and tracking progress.

### Daily Scrum

* A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team.
* Held every day of the Sprint.
* The Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours.
* Optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting progress and forecasting upcoming work.
* Held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.

- **Purpose of Daily Scrum:**
    * Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog.
    * Optimize the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal.
    * Help the Development Team understand how to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.

- **Structure of Daily Scrum:**
    * The structure is set by the Development Team.
    * Can be conducted in different ways, including using questions or discussion-based.
    * An example of questions that might be used:
        * What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        * What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        * Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### Development Work
**Development work** is the process of creating or enhancing products/services, from idea generation to final implementation.

1. **Ideation**: Generate ideas through brainstorming and market research to spot needs.
