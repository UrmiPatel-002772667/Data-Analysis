# Regression Testing
Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality. This type of testing can apply to large changes, bug fixes, or system optimizations, verifying that the pre-existing code continues to work as expected.

## Test Suites in Regression Testing
A **test suite** is a collection of test cases designed to verify specific functions. It may contain multiple test cases that cover existing functionality, and testers select cases from the suite to examine the effects of new code on existing features.

## Regression Testing Strategies

1. **Re-test All**  
   Runs the entire test suite, ensuring full validation. Although thorough, it is resource-intensive and usually reserved for high-risk projects (e.g., robotics, medical software).

2. **Regression Test Selection**  
   Focuses on selecting test cases that cover impacted parts of the system. Three main selection techniques:
   - **Safe Selection**: Tests all elements affected by the changes.
   - **Minimization**: Selects only essential test cases covering the impacted code.
   - **Coverage**: Selects test cases based on a target coverage percentage, reducing testing costs.

3. **Test Case Prioritization**  
   Prioritizes high-impact test cases. Criteria include:
   - **Complexity**: High-complexity tests target code areas more likely to produce errors.
   - **High Error Discovery**: Tests with a history of identifying many errors.
   - **Input Validation**: Focuses on testing inputs for accurate data handling.
   - **Mission-Critical Functions**: Prioritizes core business functions essential to continuity.

4. **Hybrid Strategy**  
   Combines prioritization and selection, creating a balanced approach that is cost-effective and efficient.

## Types of Regression Testing

1. **Corrective Regression Testing**  
   Verifies unchanged functions by re-running existing test cases to confirm alignment with current functionality.

2. **Progressive Regression Testing**  
   Tests new functionality alongside existing functions, ensuring new additions donâ€™t affect previous features.

3. **Selective Regression Testing**  
   Targets specific parts of the system for testing, focusing on only the components impacted by recent changes.

4. **Partial Regression Testing**  
   Applies to sections of code modified by updates, using a subset of tests relevant to these changes.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Automation:** Automate regression tests to save time and increase efficiency.
- **Test Environment Management:** Ensure a stable and reliable test environment.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Integrate regression testing into the CI/CD pipeline for faster feedback.
