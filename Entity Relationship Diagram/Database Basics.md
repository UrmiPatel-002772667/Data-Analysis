# Database Concepts

- **Database:** Database is an organized collection of logically related data.
- **Data:** Data is a stored representation of objects.
- **Information:** Information is a processed data to increase knowledge.
- **Metadata:** Properties or characteristics of data.
  
## Data Model
   Data model is a visual representation of information system to communicate data structures and their relationships.
   
## Data Types
- **Structured Data:** Numbers, text, dates.
- **Unstructured Data:** Images, videos, documents.

## Range of Database Applications
1. **Personal Databases**
   - Typical size: Megabytes.
   - Intended for one user.

2. **Departmental Multi-Tiered Client/Server Databases**
   - Typical size: Gigabytes.
   - Intended for several users, usually doesnâ€™t exceed 100, department-wide.

3. **Enterprise Applications**
   - Typical size: Gigabytes, terabytes, or even petabytes.
   - Intended for a very large user base, company-wide.

## Types of Databases
- **Relational Databases:** Organize data into tables with predefined schemas.  
  Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

- **NoSQL Databases:** Handle large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data.  
  Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra.

- **Cloud Databases:** Designed to run in the cloud.  
  Examples: Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS, Oracle Autonomous Database.

- **Columnar Databases:** Store data in columns rather than rows, often used in data warehouses for analytical queries.  
  Examples: Google BigQuery, Cassandra, HBase.

- **Key-Value Databases:** Save data as a group of key-value pairs, one of the simplest types of NoSQL databases.  
  Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.

- **Time-Series Databases:** Handle time-stamped or time-series data efficiently.  
  Examples: Amazon Timestream, InfluxDB, Prometheus, OpenTSDB.

## Advantages of Databases
- Program data independence.
- Planned data redundancy.
- Improved data consistency.
- Improved data sharing.
- Increased application development productivity.
- Enforcement of standards.
- Improved data quality.
- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness.
- Reduced program maintenance.
- Improved decision support.

# Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. **Planning**
   - **Purpose:** Establish a preliminary understanding.
   - **Deliverable:** Request for study.

2. **Analysis**
   - **Purpose:** Conduct thorough requirements analysis and structuring.
   - **Deliverable:** Functional system specification.

3. **Logical Design**
   - **Purpose:** Elicit information requirements and structure them.
   - **Deliverable:** Detailed design specification.

4. **Physical Design**
   - **Purpose:** Develop technology and organizational specifications.
   - **Deliverable:** Program/data structures, technology purchases, organization redesigns.

5. **Implementation**
   - **Purpose:** Programming, testing, training, installation, and documentation.
   - **Deliverable:** Operational programs, documentation, training materials.

6. **Maintenance**
   - **Purpose:** Monitor, repair, and enhance the system.
   - **Deliverable:** Periodic audits.

## Business Rules
A statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. Business rules prevent, cause, or suggest actions within the business.

### Characteristics of Business Rules
- **Declarative:** Focuses on what, not how.
- **Precise:** Clear, agreed-upon meaning.
- **Atomic:** One statement per rule.
- **Consistent:** Internally and externally consistent.
- **Expressible:** Structured, natural language.
- **Distinct:** Non-redundant.
- **Business-Oriented:** Understood by business people.
