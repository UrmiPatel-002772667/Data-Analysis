## Profitability Ratios

### Example 1:
Consider a company with the following financial data:
- Revenue: $1,000,000
- Cost of Goods Sold: $600,000
- Net Income: $200,000
- Average Total Assets: $1,500,000
- Average Shareholders' Equity: $800,000

**Calculations:**
- **Gross Profit Margin (GPM):**    
  $GPM = \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{1,000,000 - 600,000}{1,000,000} \times 100 = 40\\%$

- **Net Profit Margin (NPM):**  
  $NPM = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 = \frac{200,000}{1,000,000} \times 100 = 20\\%$

- **Return on Assets (ROA):**  
  $ROA = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} \times 100 = \frac{200,000}{1,500,000} \times 100 \approx 13.33\\%$ 

- **Return on Equity (ROE):**  
  $ROE = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \times 100 = \frac{200,000}{800,000} \times 100 = 25\\%$

## Liquidity & Solvency Ratios

### Example 2:
Consider a company with the following financial data:
- Current Assets: $500,000
- Current Liabilities: $300,000
- Inventory: $100,000
- Total Debt: $600,000
- Shareholders' Equity: $800,000
- Operating Income: $200,000
- Interest Expense: $50,000

**Calculations:**
- **Current Ratio:**  
  $\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{500,000}{300,000} = 1.67$

- **Quick Ratio:**  
  $Quick\ Ratio = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{500,000 - 100,000}{300,000} = 1.33$

- **Debt to Equity Ratio:**  
  $Debt\ to\ Equity\ Ratio = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholders’ Equity}} = \frac{600,000}{800,000} = 0.75$

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:**  
  $Interest\ Coverage\ Ratio = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Interest Expense}} = \frac{200,000}{50,000} = 4$

- **Debt Ratio:**  
  $Debt\ Ratio = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} = \frac{600,000}{500,000} = 1.2$
  
### Example 3:
**Balance Sheet (Values in millions):**
- Total Assets: $800  
- Total Liabilities: $400  
- Current Assets: $300  
- Current Liabilities: $150  
- Long-term Debt: $200  
- Shareholders' Equity: $400  

**Income Statement (Values in millions):**
- Net Income: $50  
- Total Revenue: $500  
- Operating Expenses: $300  
- Interest Expense: $20  
- Taxes: $30  

**Calculations:**
- **Current Ratio:**
  - $\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{300}{150} = 2$
  - The current ratio of 2 indicates that the company has twice the current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, reflecting a healthy liquidity position.

- **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
   - $\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{300}{150} = 2$
   - With a quick ratio of 2 (assuming no significant inventory), XYZ Company can cover its short-term liabilities twice over, signaling strong liquidity.
   
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
   - $\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholders’ Equity}} = \frac{200}{400} = 0.5$
   - The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 suggests that XYZ Company has a conservative capital structure, relying less on debt financing.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:**
  - $\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Income} + \text{Interest Expense} + \text{Taxes}}{\text{Interest Expense}} = \frac{50 + 20 + 30}{20} = 5$
  - An interest coverage ratio of 5 implies that XYZ Company generates enough income to cover its interest expenses comfortably.

**Analysis:**
- **Liquidity:** The current and quick ratios both stand at 2, suggesting that the company is in a solid liquidity position, with sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
- **Solvency:** The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 reflects a balanced approach to debt and equity financing. The interest coverage ratio of 5 indicates a strong ability to meet interest obligations.

**Additional Information:**
- Inventory: $50 million  
- Prepaid Expenses: $10 million  
- Accrued Liabilities: $20 million  
- Depreciation Expense: $30 million  
- Common Shares Outstanding: 100 million  

**Revised Calculations:**
- **Current Ratio:**
  - $\text{Current Assets} = 300 + 50 + 10 = 360 \quad (\text{Including Inventory and Prepaid Expenses})$
  - $\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{360}{150} = 2.4$
  - With the inclusion of inventory and prepaid expenses, the current ratio improves to 2.4, indicating even stronger liquidity.

- **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
   - $\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{360 - 50}{150} = 2.1$
   - After subtracting inventory, the quick ratio becomes 2.1, still reflecting strong liquidity.

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
  - $\text{Total Debt} = 200 + 20 = 220 \quad (\text{Including Long-term Debt and Accrued Liabilities})$
  - $\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{220}{400} = 0.55$
  - The debt-to-equity ratio increases slightly to 0.55, indicating a higher reliance on debt relative to equity.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:**
   - $\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{50 + 20 + 30 + 30}{20} = 4$
   - The interest coverage ratio decreases to 4, reflecting a slight reduction in the company’s ability to cover interest expenses, likely due to higher depreciation.

**Updated Analysis:**
- **Liquidity:** With the inclusion of inventory and prepaid expenses, both the current and quick ratios show an improvement, indicating even stronger liquidity than before.
- **Solvency:** The debt-to-equity ratio rises to 0.55, signaling a marginally higher reliance on debt. The interest coverage ratio drops to 4, suggesting a slightly reduced ability to meet interest obligations, potentially due to increased depreciation costs.

## Efficiency and Activity Ratios:

- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**
  - Assume **COGS** = $500,000 and **Average Inventory** = $100,000.  
  - $\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}} = \frac{500,000}{100,000} = 5$

- **Receivables Turnover Ratio**
  - Assume **Net Credit Sales** = $1,000,000 and **Average Accounts Receivable** = $200,000.  
  - $\text{Receivables Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} = \frac{1,000,000}{200,000} = 5$

- **Asset Turnover Ratio**
  - Assume **Net Sales** = $2,000,000 and **Average Total Assets** = $1,000,000.  
  - $\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} = \frac{2,000,000}{1,000,000} = 2$

**Analysis**:
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: With a ratio of 5, this means the company sells and replaces its inventory five times within the period, showing efficient inventory management.
- **Receivables Turnover Ratio**: The ratio of 5 indicates that the company collects its receivables five times during the period, reflecting effective management of receivables.
- **Asset Turnover Ratio**: A ratio of 2 means the company generates $2 in sales for every $1 in assets, suggesting efficient use of its assets to generate revenue.

## Market and Valuation Ratios

Market and valuation ratios are critical for investors and analysts to assess a company’s performance and its stock market valuation. Below is a breakdown of key ratios with examples and live calculations.

- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
  - Suppose **Company ABC** has a market price per share of $50 and an EPS of $5.  
  - $\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}} = \frac{50}{5} = 10$
  - **Interpretation**: A P/E ratio of 10 means investors are willing to pay $10 for every $1 of earnings the company generates. A high P/E ratio may suggest high growth expectations, while a low ratio could indicate undervaluation or low growth prospects.

- **Dividend Yield**
  - Suppose **Company XYZ** pays an annual dividend of $2 per share, and the market price per share is $40.  
  - $\text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{40} \right) \times 100 = 5\%$
  - **Interpretation**: A dividend yield of 5% means investors earn 5% of their investment in the form of dividends annually. Higher dividend yields can attract income-focused investors.

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
  - Suppose **Company LMN** has a net income of $5 million and 1 million outstanding shares.  
  - $\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Shares}} = \frac{5,000,000}{1,000,000} = 5$
  - **Interpretation**: EPS of 5 means that for every share outstanding, the company earned $5. A higher EPS indicates better profitability.

- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**
  - Suppose **Company PQR** has a market price per share of $60 and a book value per share of $40.  
  - $\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}} = \frac{60}{40} = 1.5$
  - **Interpretation**: A P/B ratio of 1.5 means that the company’s market value is 1.5 times its book value. A ratio above 1 suggests that the market values the company more highly than its book value, often due to intangible assets or growth potential.

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**
  - Suppose **Company XYZ** has a net income of $8 million and shareholders' equity of $50 million.  
  - $\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \times 100 = \frac{8,000,000}{50,000,000} \times 100 = 16\%$
  - **Interpretation**: An ROE of 16% means the company generates a return of 16% on shareholders' equity. A higher ROE suggests more efficient use of equity capital to generate profits.

### Example 4:
**Financial Data:** 
Net Income: $150,000,000 
Earnings Per Share (EPS): $5.00 
Dividends Paid: $75,000,000 
Market Price per Share: $75.00 
Book Value per Share: $50.00 
Total Shareholders' Equity: $2,500,000,000 
Total Assets: $5,000,000,000 
Total Liabilities: $2,500,000,000 
Total Outstanding Shares: 30,000,000 
Common Stock: $1,000,000,000 
Preferred Stock: $500,000,000 

**Calculations:**
Here are the detailed calculations for each ratio:  

- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**  
  $P/E = \frac{75}{5} = 15.0$  

- **Dividend Yield**  
  - *Step 1: Calculate Dividends per Share*   
    $\text{Dividends per Share} = \frac{\text{Dividends Paid}}{\text{Total Outstanding Shares}} = \frac{75,000,000}{30,000,000} = 2.50$
  - *Step 2: Calculate Dividend Yield*    
    $\text{Dividend Yield} = \left(\frac{2.50}{75}\right) \times 100 = 3.33\\%$

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**  
  $ROE = \left(\frac{150,000,000}{2,500,000,000}\right) \times 100 = 6.0\\%$  

- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**  
  $P/B = \frac{75}{50} = 1.5$

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**  
  $EPS = \frac{150,000,000}{30,000,000} = 5.00$

## Trend Analysis

### Example 5:
Consider a company's revenue over three years:
- 2019: $500,000
- 2020: $600,000
- 2021: $750,000

Calculate the percentage change for each year to identify the growth trend:
- 2020: $\frac{600,000 - 500,000}{500,000} \times 100 = 20\\%$
- 2021: $\frac{750,000 - 600,000}{600,000} \times 100 = 25\\%$

## DuPont Analysis
### Example 8:
Let's apply DuPont Analysis to XYZ Corp:
  - **NPM** = 15%
  - **TAT** = 1.2
  - **EM** = 1.5
  - $ROE = 15\% \times 1.2 \times 1.5 = 27\\%$

### Example 9:
Net Income: $100,000 - 20000 = 80000
Total Assets: $500,000 - 50000 = 450000
Total Equity: $350,000
Total Revenue: $600,000
Total Liabilities: $150,000 + 80000

**Calculation:**
NPM = 80000/600000 * 100 = 13.33
TAT = 600000/450000 = 1.33
EM = 500000/350000 = 1.42

ROI = 13.33 * 1.33 * 1.42 = 25.175
