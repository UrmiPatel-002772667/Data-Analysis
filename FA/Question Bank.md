For example, when analyzing financial ratios or index numbers, figures from the base year are set at 100, and future values are compared against it to determine percentage increases or decreases.
64. **What is meant by intra firm comparison?**  
    - Intra firm comparison involves evaluating the performance of various departments, divisions, or units within the same organization. It helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses internally by comparing key metrics such as productivity, profitability, or efficiency across different time periods or branches. This analysis aids management in improving overall performance and resource allocation.
65. **Explain Regression analysis.**  
    - Regression analysis is a statistical method used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in forecasting, predicting outcomes, and making data-driven decisions. For example, in finance, it can determine how changes in advertising spend (independent variable) affect sales (dependent variable), enabling businesses to optimize strategies.
66. **Explain the limitations of multivariate analysis.**  
    - Multivariate analysis, while powerful, has limitations. It requires a large and clean dataset for accurate results. Complex relationships may lead to difficulties in interpretation. It can be time-consuming and computationally intensive. The results may be misleading if multicollinearity exists between variables or assumptions like normality and linearity are violated.
67. **Distinguish between cash flow statement and balance sheet.**  
    - A cash flow statement shows cash inflows and outflows over a specific period, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities. It helps assess liquidity and cash management. In contrast, a balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific date, showing assets, liabilities, and equity. The cash flow statement focuses on movement, while the balance sheet focuses on status.
68. **What is cash ratio?**  
    - The cash ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets—cash and cash equivalents. It is calculated as:  
    - **Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities**  
    - A ratio greater than 1 indicates strong liquidity, though extremely high values may suggest inefficient use of cash.
69. **Describe cash flow statement.**  
    - A cash flow statement summarizes the cash inflows and outflows from a business over a period. It is divided into three sections:  
        1. Operating activities – core business operations  
        2. Investing activities – asset purchases/sales  
        3. Financing activities – loans and equity  
    - It helps stakeholders understand how well a company generates and uses cash, offering insights into liquidity and financial health.
70. **What is EPS? Give one example.**  
    - EPS (Earnings Per Share) indicates a company's profitability on a per-share basis. It is calculated as:  
    - **EPS = Net Profit / Number of Outstanding Shares**  
    - For example, if a company earns ₹1,00,000 and has 10,000 shares, EPS = ₹10. A higher EPS generally indicates better profitability and is closely watched by investors.
71. **Calculate quick assets and current liabilities:**  
    - Given:  
      Current ratio = 2.7, Quick ratio = 1.8, Working capital = ₹340,000  
      Let current liabilities = x  
      Then current assets = 2.7x  
    - So, working capital = 2.7x – x = 1.7x = ₹340,000 → x = ₹200,000  
      Current liabilities = ₹200,000  
      Current assets = ₹540,000  
      Quick assets = 1.8 × ₹200,000 = ₹360,000
72. **State three objectives of ratio analysis.**  
    - **Evaluate Financial Performance:** Analyze profitability, liquidity, and solvency.  
    - **Support Decision-Making:** Aid managers and investors in taking strategic decisions.  
    - **Facilitate Comparisons:** Compare performance over time or with industry peers.  
    These help in identifying financial strengths, weaknesses, and areas requiring improvement.
73. **Discuss different types of report prepared by a company.**  
    - Companies prepare various reports:  
      1. **Statutory Reports:** Required by law (e.g., audit reports, financial statements).  
      2. **Internal Reports:** For management use (e.g., budgeting, performance analysis).  
      3. **Financial Reports:** Balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement.  
      4. **CSR and Sustainability Reports:** Showcase social and environmental initiatives.  
    - Each serves a specific purpose for decision-making and accountability.
74. **What are the objectives of sustainability reporting?**  
    - Sustainability reporting aims to:  
      1. **Promote Transparency:** Disclose environmental and social performance.  
      2. **Enhance Stakeholder Trust:** Engage investors, employees, and customers.  
      3. **Support Long-term Strategy:** Highlight sustainable practices and risks.  
    - It reflects a company’s commitment to ethical practices, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility.
75. **Write short note on interest coverage ratio.**  
    - Interest Coverage Ratio measures a company’s ability to pay interest on debt.  
    - **Formula:** EBIT / Interest Expense  
    - A higher ratio indicates better debt-servicing capacity. For instance, a ratio of 4 means the company earns four times its interest obligations, reducing financial risk and increasing lender confidence.
76. **Write three problems in analyzing financial statements.**  
    1. **Window Dressing:** Companies may manipulate figures to appear stronger.  
    2. **Lack of Uniformity:** Different accounting policies hinder comparability.  
    3. **Historical Nature:** Financial statements reflect past data, not current trends or market conditions, limiting future projections.
77. **Give three examples of cash flow from investing activities.**  
    1. **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** Outflow for plant, machinery, etc.  
    2. **Sale of Investments:** Inflow from selling shares or bonds.  
    3. **Loan to Others:** Cash outflow for granting loans.  
    These reflect long-term investment decisions of the business.
78. **Write short note on financial leverage.**  
    - Financial leverage refers to the use of debt to finance assets. It amplifies returns to shareholders if earnings exceed interest costs.  
    - **Formula:** Debt/Equity Ratio  
    - While leverage can increase profits, excessive use may raise default risk. It’s a key factor in risk management and capital structuring.
79. **Calculate stock & current assets:**  
    - Given: Current ratio = 2.6, Liquid ratio = 1.5, Current liabilities = ₹40,000  
      Current assets = 2.6 × ₹40,000 = ₹1,04,000  
      Liquid assets = 1.5 × ₹40,000 = ₹60,000  
    - Stock = Current assets – Liquid assets = ₹1,04,000 – ₹60,000 = ₹44,000
80. **What are the uses of preparing cash flow statement?**  
    1. **Assess Liquidity:** Shows cash availability to meet obligations.  
    2. **Analyze Operations:** Understand cash generated from business activities.  
    3. **Financial Planning:** Aids in forecasting and managing cash.

    2. **Creditors:** Assess creditworthiness and liquidity.  
    3. **Management:** Make operational and strategic decisions.  
    4. **Analysts & Regulators:** Analyze performance and compliance.

    2. **Facilitates Comparison:** Compare with industry or past performance.  
    3. **Helps Decision-Making:** Aids in planning and investment decisions.
