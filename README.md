**What is Data Analysis?**

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.

## Methods of Data Analysis
**1. Charts**
 A chart is a graphic representation of data that employs symbols to represent the data. Excel offers various chart types, including:
- **Bar Charts:** Useful for comparing quantities across different categories.
- **Line Charts:** Ideal for showing trends over time.
- **Pie Charts:** Best for representing the composition of a whole.
- **Scatter Plots:** Great for displaying relationships between two variables.

**How data is distributed**
- Scatter Plot
- Line
- Bar
- Column
  
**Analyze trends in data**
- Column
- Line
- Dual-axis Line
  
**To better understand the relationship between the subset of data**
- Scatter Plot
- Line
- Bubble

**Compare values**
- Bar
- Column
- Line 
- Scatter plot
- Bullet

**See components of your data**
- Pie
- Stacked Bar
- Stacked Column
- Area 
- Waterfall

**2. Conditional Formatting**:
- Conditional Formatting in Excel allows you to highlight patterns and trends within your data by applying specific formatting to cells based on their content. This feature is essential for quickly identifying critical information and visualizing key data points.

- You can define rules that format cells based on values, such as highlighting cells above a certain threshold, changing font color based on specific text, or creating data bars that visually represent the magnitude of values

**3. Sorting**:
- Data analysis Excel requires sorting the data. A list of names may be arranged alphabetically, a list of sales numbers can be arranged from highest to lowest, or rows can be sorted by colors or icons.

**4. Filter**:
- You may use filtering to pull information from a given Range or table that satisfies the specified criteria in data analysis excel. This is a fast method of just showing the data you require.
  
## Types of Data Analysis

### Data Mining

Data Mining involves analyzing large datasets to uncover previously unknown, interesting patterns, anomalies, and dependencies. This type of analysis is crucial for discovering insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

### Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence (BI) encompasses the techniques and tools used to acquire and transform vast amounts of unstructured business data. BI helps identify new opportunities, develop strategies, and create actionable insights for better business outcomes.

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical Analysis is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It forms the backbone of data analysis, allowing you to draw meaningful conclusions from your data through measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

### Predictive Analytics

Predictive Analytics uses statistical models to analyze current and historical data to forecast future events. This type of analysis is invaluable for predicting trends, behaviors, and events, enabling proactive decision-making.

### Text Analytics

Text Analytics, also known as Text Mining or Text Data Mining, involves extracting high-quality information from text. This process typically includes structuring the input text, identifying patterns using statistical models, and interpreting the results. Text Analytics is widely used in sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and automated content categorization.

## Statistics: 
`Gather Data -> Prepare Data -> Analyze Data -> Interpret Data -> Insight`

### Types of Statistics: 
**Descriptive Statistics**
- Collecting, organizing, summarizing & presenting
- **Measures of central tendency**
	- Mean: The average of a data set, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
	- Median: The middle value of a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, it's the average of the two middle numbers.
	- Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a data set.
	- Quartiles: These divide a data set into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half, the second quartile (Q2) is the median of the entire data set, and the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half.
- **Measure of Dispersion**
	- Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
	- Variance: A measure of how much the values in a data set differ from the mean.
	- Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set.
		
**Inferential Statistics**
- Concluding a population based on sample data
- Testing hypotheses
- Sample size
- Margin of error
- Statistically significant
- Designing tests

**PIVOT TABLE**
  
  A powerful tool to summarize, analyze, explore, and present data. Pivot tables allow you to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data to obtain a desired report.

2. Go to the "Insert" tab and click "PivotTable."
3. Choose where you want the Pivot Table report to be placed.
4. Drag fields to the Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters areas to create your report.

## Advanced Analysis Techniques
1. **Regression Analysis**
   
  Regression analysis in Excel helps understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. This technique can be used to predict trends, forecast future values, and determine the strength of relationships between variables.

3. **What-If Analysis**
   
  What-if analysis is a powerful tool in Excel that allows you to explore different scenarios and their potential outcomes based on various inputs. This is particularly useful in data analysis for:

- **Budget Planning:** Proposing different budgets based on varying revenue estimates.
- **Forecasting:** Predicting future values using historical data.
- **Goal Achievement:** Determining the input values needed to achieve a specific result from a formula.

#### What-If Analysis Tools:

1. **Data Tables**
   
  Data Tables allow you to observe how changes in one or two variables affect the outcome of a formula. This is useful for sensitivity analysis, such as seeing how different interest rates impact loan payments.

3. **Scenario Manager**
   
  The Scenario Manager enables you to create and save different sets of input values (scenarios) for your data. You can quickly switch between these scenarios to see the effects on your results, making it easier to compare various strategies or plans.

4. **Goal Seek**
   
  Goal Seek works by calculating the required input value to achieve a specific goal. For instance, if you need to reach a particular profit margin, Goal Seek will determine the sales figure needed to achieve that goal.

3. **Data Validation**
   
  Data validation ensures the accuracy and quality of your data by restricting the type of data that can be entered into a cell. 

- **Display an Input Message:** Provide guidance on what should be entered in the cell.
- **Restrict Data Entry:** Limit the type or range of values that can be entered, ensuring that only valid data is input.
- **Create a Drop-Down List:** Provide a predefined list of acceptable values for users to choose from, simplifying data entry.
- **Show an Error Alert:** If invalid data is entered, you can display an error message and reject the entry to maintain data accuracy.
