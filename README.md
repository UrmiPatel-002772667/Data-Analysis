Types: 
Descriptive Statistics
	- Collecting, organizing, summarizing & presenting
	- Measures of central tendency
		○ Mean: The average of a data set, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
		○ Median: The middle value of a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, it's the average of the two middle numbers.
		○ Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a data set.
		○ Quartiles: These divide a data set into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half, the second quartile (Q2) is the median of the entire data set, and the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half.
	- Measure of Dispersion
		○ Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
		○ Variance: A measure of how much the values in a data set differ from the mean.
		○ Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set.

What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.

Methods of Data Analysis
Charts
Any set of information may be graphically represented in a chart. A chart is a graphic representation of data that employs symbols to represent the data.
Conditional Formatting
Patterns and trends in your data may be highlighted with the help of conditional formatting.
Sorting
Data analysis Excel requires sorting the data. A list of names may be arranged alphabetically, a list of sales numbers can be arranged from highest to lowest, or rows can be sorted by colors or icons. 
Filter
You may use filtering to pull information from a given Range or table that satisfies the specified criteria in data analysis excel. This is a fast method of just showing the data you require. 

Excel functions for data analysis
LEN
=LEN quickly returns the character count in a given cell. The =LEN formula may be used to calculate the number of characters needed in a cell to distinguish between two different kinds of product Stock Keeping Units. 
=LEN(Select Cell)
TRIM
=TRIM function will remove all spaces from a cell, except single spaces between words. The most frequent application of this function is to get rid of trailing spaces. 
=TRIM(Select Cell)
UPPER
The Excel Text function “UPPER Function” will change the text to all capital letters (UPPERCASE).
=UPPER(Text)
PROPER
Any subsequent letters of text that come after a character other than a letter will also be capitalized by PROPER.
=PROPER(Text)
COUNTIF
Excel has a built-in function called COUNTIF that counts the given cells.
 =COUNTIF(range,criteria)
AVERAGEIF
AVERAGEIF determines the average of a range depending on a true or false condition.
=AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, [average_range])
SUMIF
SUMIF determines if a condition is true or false before adding the values in a range.
=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
VLOOKUP
VLOOKUP permits searching across several columns.
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
PIVOT TABLE
To create the required report, a pivot table is a statistics tool that condenses and reorganizes specific columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table. The utility simply “pivots” or rotates the data to examine it from various angles rather than altering the spreadsheet or database itself.
