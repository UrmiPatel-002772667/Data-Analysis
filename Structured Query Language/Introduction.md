# Introduction to SQL

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS) and is essential for querying, updating, and managing data.

## Key Aspects of SQL:
- **Function:** SQL is used for managing relational databases by providing commands for data definition, data manipulation, and data control.
- **Standards:** SQL is standardized by organizations such as ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization).
- **Use Cases:** Common use cases include querying data, updating records, creating and modifying database structures, and controlling access to data.
- **Inception:** SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s for the purpose of managing data in the System R project.
- **Standardization:** Over time, SQL has evolved and been standardized to ensure compatibility across different database systems.
- **Evolutions:** SQL has undergone several updates and revisions, leading to new versions with additional features and optimizations.
- **Variations:** Although SQL is standardized, various RDBMSs like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server implement their own variations and extensions of SQL.

# Data Management and Querying

SQL is designed to manage data effectively in relational databases. It allows for structured querying and data retrieval, which are fundamental operations in any database system. The language is divided into several sub-languages, each serving a specific purpose in database management.

## SQL Sub-Languages

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
   - DDL is used to define the structure of a database. It includes commands that create, alter, and drop database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.
   - **Key Commands:**
     - `CREATE`: Defines new tables, indexes, or views.
     - `ALTER`: Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
     - `DROP`: Deletes tables, indexes, or views.
     - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all rows from a table without deleting the table structure.
   - **Role in Database Design:** DDL is crucial during the physical design phase of database development, where the database schema is defined.

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
   - DML is used for data manipulation within the database. It includes commands that insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables.
   - **Key Commands:**
     - `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
     - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records.
     - `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.
     - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
   - **Role in Database Implementation:** DML is used during the implementation phase to populate the database and manage ongoing data operations.

3. **DCL (Data Control Language):**
   - DCL is used to control access to data in the database. It includes commands that grant or revoke privileges to users.
   - **Key Commands:**
     - `GRANT`: Assigns privileges to users or roles.
     - `ADD`: Add privileges to users or roles.
     - `REVOKE`: Removes privileges from users or roles.
   - **Role in Database Maintenance:** DCL is essential for maintaining security and enforcing access control policies.
