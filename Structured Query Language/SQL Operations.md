## Types of SQL Operations

### 1. Adding, Modifying, and Dropping Elements

**Adding Elements:**
- Use the `INSERT` statement to add rows to a table.
  - **No column specification:** Insert values without specifying columns.
  - **With column specification:** Insert values specifying columns.
  - **Table with identity column:** Insert values into a table that has an auto-incrementing identity column.

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES(value1, value2, value3);
```

**Modifying Elements:**
- Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the structure of an existing table.

**Example:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name NEW_DATATYPE;
```
**Renaming a Table:**
- Use the `SP_RENAME` stored procedure to rename a table.

**Example:**
```sql
EXEC SP_RENAME 'old_table_name', 'new_table_name';
```

**Dropping Elements:**
- Use the `DROP TABLE` statement to remove a table from the database.

**Example:**
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

## SQL Statements
**1. ALTER Statement**
- Modifies the structure of an existing table by adding, dropping, or altering columns.
**2. INSERT Statement**
- Adds new rows to a table.
**3. DROP Statement**
- Removes database objects, such as tables or indexes, from the database.
**4. DELETE Statement**
- Deletes rows from a table based on a specified condition.
**5. TRUNCATE Statement**
- Removes all rows from a table but preserves the table structure for future use.
**6. UPDATE Statement**
- Modifies existing data in a table.
**7. SELECT Statement**
- Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.

## SQL Query Clauses
**1. SELECT**
- Specifies the columns to retrieve from a table or view.
  **Example:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```
**2. FROM**
- Specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve data.
**3. WHERE**
Filters rows based on a specified condition.
**4. GROUP BY**
- Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data.
**5. ORDER BY**
- Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

**Example of a Full Query:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1
ORDER BY column2 DESC;
```

### Aggregate Functions:
- Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

**COUNT**: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
**SUM**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
**AVG**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
**MIN**: Returns the smallest value in a set.
**MAX**: Returns the largest value in a set.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(column_name), AVG(column_name), MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

- **Scalar Aggregate:** Returns a single value from an SQL query that includes an aggregate function.
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
  ```
- **Vector Aggregate:** Returns multiple values from an SQL query that includes an aggregate function.
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, AVG(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name;
  ```


  
SELECT Statement: Used to retrieve data from a database.
Wildcard (*): Used to select all columns from a table.
Filtering with WHERE Clause: Using conditions to filter data, including case sensitivity considerations.
Basic LIKE Operator: For pattern matching with wildcards (%).
Numeric Comparisons: Using operators like =, >, <, >=, and <= for filtering numerical data.



SELECT Statement Basics: The SELECT command retrieves data, with the * wildcard used to select all columns from a table.
Column Selection: Instead of using *, specific columns can be selected by naming them after SELECT and separating them with commas.
FROM Clause: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.
WHERE Clause: Filters data based on conditions. The lecture discusses filtering by text (e.g., department names) and numeric values (e.g., salaries).
Case Sensitivity: SQL keywords are case-insensitive, but data values are case-sensitive.
Best Practices: It’s recommended to capitalize SQL keywords and use lowercase for table and column names for readability.
LIKE Operator: Used for pattern matching within text data.
Numeric Filtering: The lecture explains filtering data based on numeric conditions using operators like =, >, <, >=, and <=.



Basic Structure of SELECT Statement: The SELECT clause specifies columns to retrieve, the FROM clause specifies the table, and the WHERE clause filters data based on conditions.

Understanding Conditions: A condition is something that evaluates to true or false. For example, 1 = 1 is always true, so it returns all records. In contrast, 1 < 1 is false, so no records are returned.

Filtering Data: The WHERE clause filters records based on conditions like salary < 100,000. The condition is checked against every record, and only those that satisfy the condition are returned.

Combining Conditions with AND: The AND operator allows multiple conditions. All conditions must be true for a record to be returned, such as retrieving employees from a specific department with a salary above a certain amount.

Using OR for Flexibility: The OR operator is used when only one of multiple conditions needs to be true. This allows retrieving records that meet either of the specified conditions.

Combining AND and OR: Parentheses are necessary to group conditions logically when combining AND and OR to ensure the query returns the desired results.

Logical Inconsistencies: Using AND with mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., department = 'sports' AND department = 'tools') results in no records being returned because a single record cannot satisfy both conditions.

Basic Structure of a SELECT Statement:

SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM: Identifies the table to query.
WHERE: Filters the data based on a condition that evaluates to either true or false.
Simple Conditions:

Conditions in the WHERE clause can check if certain data meets specified criteria, such as salary > 100000. The condition is applied to each row in the table, and only rows where the condition is true are returned.
Combining Conditions with AND and OR:

The AND operator requires all conditions to be true for a row to be returned.
The OR operator allows a row to be returned if any one of the conditions is true.
Conditions can be combined with both AND and OR to form more complex queries.
Use of Parentheses:

Parentheses are used to group conditions, ensuring that certain parts of the query are evaluated together. This is crucial when combining AND and OR to avoid logical errors.
Logical Consistency:

The lecture emphasizes understanding the logical structure of queries. For example, a query using AND to filter for employees working in both “Sports” and “Tools” departments will return no results because a single employee can’t belong to both departments simultaneously.
Case Study Examples:

Examples include filtering employees by salary, department, and region, using combinations of AND and OR to refine results.



Filtering with NOT Operator: The NOT operator reverses the result of a condition. For example, WHERE department = 'sports' returns only records with "sports," while WHERE NOT department = 'sports' returns all records except those with "sports."

Alternative Not Equal Operators: SQL provides several ways to filter for non-matching values, including !=, <>, and NOT.

Null Values: Null represents missing data in SQL. The correct way to filter for nulls is using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL, as null cannot be compared directly with = or !=.

Using the IN Operator: The IN operator simplifies filtering based on a list of values. For example, WHERE department IN ('sports', 'toys', 'garden') filters records belonging to any of those departments.

Range Filtering with BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator is used to filter data within a range, such as salaries between $80,000 and $100,000. This operator is inclusive of the boundary values.



In this lecture from a SQL for Data Science course on Udemy, the instructor walks through a series of exercises focusing on the WHERE clause, AND/OR operators, and the BETWEEN clause to filter records in a database. The tasks include writing SQL queries to extract specific employee data based on conditions such as gender, department, salary, and hire dates.

Key tasks and concepts covered:

Filtering Data Using AND Clause:

Retrieve employee names and emails where gender is female, the department is "Tools," and the salary exceeds $110,000.
Combining AND and OR Clauses:

Retrieve employee names and hire dates for those earning over $165,000 or working in the "Sports" department and being male.
Using BETWEEN for Date Ranges:

Retrieve employee names and hire dates for those hired between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2004.
Complex Filtering with Multiple Conditions:

Retrieve all columns for employees earning between $40,000 and $100,000 in the "Automotive" department and are male, or who are female and work in the "Toys" department.
Commenting in SQL:

The instructor also demonstrates how to use comments in SQL scripts to leave notes for other developers or to temporarily disable parts of a query without removing them.


In this lecture, the instructor introduces and explains several important SQL clauses and keywords that can be used to enhance and customize query outputs. These include:

ORDER BY Clause:

Used to sort query results based on a specific column, either in ascending (default) or descending order. The keyword ASC is used for ascending order, while DESC is used for descending.
DISTINCT Clause:

Used to retrieve unique values from a specified column, removing duplicates.
LIMIT and FETCH FIRST Clauses:

LIMIT is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query, while FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY serves a similar purpose. Both are used to display only a specific number of rows from the query result.
Column Aliases:

Allows renaming of columns in the output using the AS keyword, which is useful for improving readability or customizing report formats. If the alias contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes.


In this lecture, the instructor covers various SQL functions and techniques that allow you to manipulate and format data within queries without altering the actual data in the database. Key points discussed include:

Uppercase and Lowercase Functions:

UPPER(column_name): Converts all characters in the specified column to uppercase.
LOWER(column_name): Converts all characters in the specified column to lowercase.
These functions only affect how the data is displayed, not the actual stored data.
Length and Trim Functions:

LENGTH(column_name): Returns the number of characters in the specified column.
TRIM(): Removes any leading or trailing spaces from a string. This is useful for cleaning up data that may have unnecessary spaces.
Concatenating Columns:

You can combine values from two or more columns into a new column using the || (pipes) operator. This process is known as concatenation.
For example, combining the first name and last name into a full name: first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name.
Boolean Expressions as Columns:

You can include Boolean expressions in a query to evaluate conditions directly within the query result. The result will be TRUE or FALSE.
For example, checking if an employee's salary is greater than a specific amount: salary > 140000 AS is_highly_paid.
Using IN Clause and LIKE Operator:

The IN clause allows you to check if a value exists within a set of values.
The LIKE operator is used to match patterns within text, using wildcards like % to represent any sequence of characters.
For instance, checking if a department name contains "OTH": department LIKE '%OTH%'.
Combining Functions and Expressions:

SQL allows you to nest functions and expressions within each other, such as using LENGTH(TRIM(column_name)) to first trim the data and then calculate its length.


In this lecture, the instructor introduces several powerful SQL functions used for manipulating and formatting string data, which are essential for data extraction and cleaning. Here's a summary of the key points:

Substrings:

The SUBSTRING() function is used to extract a specific portion of a string. The function takes three arguments: the text, the starting position, and the length of the substring to extract. If the length is not provided, it extracts the string from the starting position to the end.

Example: To extract the word "test" from the string "This is test data", use SUBSTRING('This is test data', 9, 4).

Replace:

The REPLACE() function allows you to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a string with another substring.

Example: Replace "clothing" with "attire" in a department name: REPLACE(department, 'clothing', 'attire').

Concatenation:

The concatenation operator (||) combines two or more strings into one.

Example: Combine department name with the word "department": department || ' department' AS complete_department_name.

Position:

The POSITION() function finds the position of a specified character or substring within a string. This can be useful for extracting specific parts of a string.

Example: Find the position of "@" in an email address: POSITION('@' IN email).

Using Position with Substring:

You can combine POSITION() with SUBSTRING() to extract parts of a string based on the position of certain characters.

Example: Extract the domain from an email address: SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email) + 1).

COALESCE:

The COALESCE() function allows you to replace NULL values in your data with a specified value, which is useful for avoiding empty cells in reports.

Example: Replace NULL values in the email column with "none": COALESCE(email, 'none') AS email.


In this lecture, the instructor introduces grouping functions in SQL, which are used to perform calculations on data to gain statistical insights. These functions are essential for analyzing numeric data and extracting aggregate information. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

Grouping Functions Overview:
Single Row Functions:

Functions like UPPER(), LOWER(), and REPLACE() are single-row functions. They operate on each row individually, returning a modified version of the data for each row.
Grouping Functions:

Grouping functions, on the other hand, aggregate data and return a single value from a set of rows. They include:
MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column.
MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.
AVG(): Returns the average value of a column.
COUNT(): Counts the number of non-null values in a column.
SUM(): Adds up all the values in a numeric column.
Examples of Grouping Functions:
MAX(salary): Returns the highest salary in the table.
MIN(salary): Returns the lowest salary.
AVG(salary): Calculates the average salary. It can be combined with the ROUND() function to remove decimals.
COUNT(employee_id): Counts the total number of employees.
COUNT(email): Counts the number of employees with non-null email addresses.
SUM(salary): Calculates the total salary paid to all employees.
Practical Usage of Grouping Functions:
Grouping functions like SUM() and COUNT() can be used to calculate total salaries, count employees, or find other aggregate metrics across all rows in a table.
These functions are valuable but can be made even more powerful by combining them with conditions or clauses, such as the WHERE clause.
Preparing for Grouping by Categories:
The lecture ends with a lead into more advanced SQL querying, where grouping functions are combined with the GROUP BY clause. This allows you to group data by categories (e.g., by department) and perform aggregate calculations for each group, such as the total salary for each department.


The lecture discusses grouping functions in SQL, which allow you to perform calculations and gain statistical insights from data. Unlike single-row functions (like UPPER, LOWER, and SUBSTRING) that process and return a value for each record, grouping functions process multiple records and return a single aggregated value. The key grouping functions introduced are:

MAX: Finds the maximum value in a column (e.g., the highest salary).
MIN: Finds the minimum value in a column (e.g., the lowest salary).


n this lecture, the concept of grouping in SQL is introduced as a precursor to a deeper dive into the GROUP BY clause in the next lecture. The instructor creates a simple temporary table called "cars" with one column named "make" to demonstrate grouping. The table is populated with vehicle makes such as Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.

The instructor explains that when selecting data from the table, duplicate entries (e.g., multiple Hondas) can be grouped together using the GROUP BY clause. The COUNT function is used to count the number of occurrences within each group. The instructor demonstrates that grouping can show how many records belong to each make, and adds null values to show that nulls are treated as a separate group.

The key takeaway is understanding that GROUP BY organizes data into groups based on a specified column, and COUNT can be used to determine the number of records in each group. This foundational concept will be explored further in subsequent lectures.
AVG: Calculates the average value in a column (e.g., average salary).
COUNT: Counts the number of records, either for a specific column or overall.


GROUP BY: Groups data by specified columns, allowing for summary statistics like total, average, minimum, and maximum values. For example, grouping by department to see total salaries per department.
WHERE Clause: Filters specific records before grouping. For instance, filtering employees by region before calculating total salaries.
COUNT Function: Used to count the number of records in each group, such as the number of employees per department.
Non-Aggregate Columns: Any non-aggregate columns in the SELECT statement must also be included in the GROUP BY clause.
HAVING Clause: Filters grouped data based on aggregate functions, which cannot be done using the WHERE clause. For example, showing only departments with more than 35 employees.



Exercises Covered:
Counting Same First Names: The first exercise asks you to find how many people have the same first name in a company. The solution involves using GROUP BY on the first name and filtering results using HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 to show only names with multiple occurrences.

Listing Unique Departments Without DISTINCT: The second exercise requires listing unique departments without using the DISTINCT keyword. The solution is to use GROUP BY department to achieve the same result.

Counting Employees by Email Domain: The third exercise involves extracting email domains from email addresses and counting how many employees have each domain. This requires using string functions (SUBSTRING and POSITION) to extract the domain part of the email and then using GROUP BY on that domain.

Report on Salaries by Gender and Region: The final exercise involves creating a report showing the minimum, maximum, and average salaries, broken down by gender and region. The solution involves selecting gender and region ID, applying the necessary aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG), and then using GROUP BY on gender and region ID. The results are then ordered first by gender and then by region ID.



Aliasing Columns and Tables: You can give tables or columns aliases (short names) to make SQL queries more concise. For example, you can use E for the employees table and D for the departments table.
Selecting Columns from Multiple Tables: When selecting columns that exist in multiple tables (e.g., department in both employees and departments), you must specify the table using the alias or full table name to avoid ambiguity.
Flexibility with SQL: SQL allows for selecting columns directly or using the * (all columns). You can also combine specific columns with all columns, giving you flexibility in how you retrieve data.
Sources in the FROM Clause: The FROM clause defines the data sources, which are typically tables but can also be subqueries. Aliases can be used to reference these sources more easily in the rest of the query.


Subqueries: A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL query. It can be used in various clauses like WHERE, FROM, and SELECT.
Using Subqueries in WHERE Clause: The instructor demonstrates how to use a subquery in the WHERE clause to filter data based on another query's results. For example, selecting employees who work in departments not listed in the department table.
Using Subqueries in FROM Clause: The instructor shows how a subquery can act as a data source in the FROM clause, treating the result set of the subquery as a table.
Aliases in Subqueries: When using subqueries, especially in the FROM clause, it's important to give the subquery an alias so that it can be referenced correctly in the outer query.
Column Aliases: The instructor also explains how to assign aliases to columns in subqueries, ensuring that the outer query can correctly reference the renamed columns.
Best Practices: The lecture emphasizes the importance of using aliases consistently when referencing columns or data sources in SQL queries, as it makes the queries clearer and easier to understand.


Review of Subqueries: The lecture begins with a quick review of using subqueries in the WHERE and FROM clauses, emphasizing how they work and how to give them aliases for clarity.

Subqueries in the SELECT Clause: The instructor introduces using subqueries in the SELECT clause. A subquery in the SELECT clause must return a single value to avoid errors, as the outer query is expected to return a set of results.

Example of Subquery in SELECT: An example is provided where the query attempts to return the first name, last name, salary, and the first name from the employees table using a subquery. The correct usage requires limiting the subquery to return only one row.

Assignments:

Assignment 1: Write a query to return all employees working in the electronics division. The solution involves using a subquery to filter departments that belong to the electronics division.
Assignment 2: Write a query to return employees who work in Asia or Canada and earn more than $130,000. This requires using a subquery to identify the relevant region IDs and combining it with a salary filter.
Assignment 3: Write a query to show the first name, department, and how much less each employee earns compared to the highest-paid employee. This involves using a subquery in the SELECT clause to calculate the salary difference.
Key Takeaways:

Subqueries provide a powerful way to make SQL queries more flexible and detailed.
When using subqueries in the SELECT clause, ensure the subquery returns a single value to avoid errors.
Practice and experimentation with subqueries are essential to mastering their use in SQL.



Key Points:
Subqueries Recap: The instructor briefly reviews subqueries, showing how they can be used in the WHERE, FROM, and SELECT clauses.

Introduction to ANY and ALL Operators:

ANY: Returns true if any of the values returned by the subquery meet the condition. Used when you want to check if a value meets at least one of the conditions in a list.
ALL: Returns true if all the values returned by the subquery meet the condition. Used when you want to check if a value meets all the conditions in a list.
These operators are useful when comparing a value to multiple results from a subquery.
Exercise 1:

Problem: Write a query to return all employees working in the kids division, with hire dates greater than all the hire dates of employees in the maintenance department.
Solution: The solution involves using subqueries to filter employees based on their department and hire date, using the ALL keyword to ensure the hire date is greater than all hire dates in the maintenance department.
Exercise 2:

Problem: Write a query to return the salary that appears most frequently among employees. If multiple salaries have the same frequency, return the highest one.
Solution: Two methods are provided:
The first method involves using GROUP BY and ORDER BY to sort the salaries by frequency and value, using LIMIT to return the top result.
The second method uses a subquery with ALL in the HAVING clause to achieve the same result.


Creating a Temporary Table for Duplicates:

The lecture begins by creating a temporary table called dupes, populated with some duplicate records. The objective is to practice removing duplicates using SQL queries.
Exercise 1: Removing Duplicates:

Task: Write a query to return only unique records from the dupes table, keeping only one instance of each name and including the corresponding ID.
Solution: The solution involves using a subquery with the GROUP BY clause to select the minimum (or maximum) ID for each unique name.
Deleting Duplicate Records:

The instructor introduces the DELETE command, demonstrating how to remove duplicate records from the dupes table by keeping only the unique records.
Dropping the Temporary Table:

After completing the exercise, the dupes table is dropped using the DROP TABLE command to clean up the temporary data.
Exercise 2: Calculating Averages While Excluding Outliers:

Task: Calculate the average salary of employees, excluding the minimum and maximum salaries to avoid the impact of outliers.
Solution: This is achieved by using a subquery to identify the minimum and maximum salaries and then excluding these values when calculating the average.


Conditional Expressions Using CASE:

The CASE statement in SQL allows you to create conditional logic within your queries. It functions similarly to an if-else statement in programming languages.
Syntax:
sql
Copy code
CASE 
    WHEN condition THEN result
    WHEN condition THEN result
    ELSE result
END
The CASE statement can be used within the SELECT clause to add a new column that categorizes data based on specified conditions.
Example - Categorizing Employee Salaries:

The instructor demonstrates how to categorize employees based on their salaries:
Employees earning less than $100,000 are labeled as "Underpaid."
Employees earning between $100,000 and $160,000 are labeled as "Paid Well."
Employees earning more than $160,000 are labeled as "Executive."
The CASE statement is used within the SELECT clause to create a new column named Category.
Adding a Custom Column Name:

The instructor shows how to give the resulting column a custom name using the AS keyword after the CASE statement.
Exercise - Counting Categories:

Task: Create a query that counts the number of employees in each category ("Underpaid," "Paid Well," and "Executive").
Hint: Use a subquery to categorize the data and then perform a GROUP BY operation on the category column.
Solution:

The solution involves wrapping the original query in a subquery and then using GROUP BY to count the number of employees in each category.
Advanced Example - Transposing Data:

The instructor further extends the lesson by showing how to transpose the data, turning rows into columns.
Using the SUM function in conjunction with CASE statements, the instructor demonstrates how to create a query that returns one row with three columns: "Underpaid," "Paid Well," and "Executive," each containing the total count of employees in that category.



Key Concepts:
Transposing Data with CASE and SUM:

The lecture builds on the concept of transposing data using the CASE statement combined with the SUM function.
This technique allows you to convert rows into columns, effectively restructuring your data for different analytical perspectives.
Assignment 1 - Transposing Department Data:

Task: Create a query that transposes department data so that each department becomes a column with the total count of employees in that department.
Approach:
Use the SUM function in combination with a CASE statement to count employees for specific departments.
Each department becomes a column, and the query sums up all occurrences where the department matches the specified value.
Solution: The query structure involves creating separate columns for each department, using CASE statements to filter and count the employees in each department.
Assignment 2 - Assigning Countries to Employees:

Task: Generate a report that assigns a country to each employee based on the region they work in, using the CASE statement to dynamically look up the country from the regions table.
Approach:
Write a query that uses subqueries within the CASE statement to dynamically determine the country for each employee based on their region ID.
Solution: The query avoids hardcoding by using subqueries to look up the appropriate country for each region ID, then assigning this value to a column in the output.
Advanced Assignment - Counting Employees by Country:

Task: Generate a report that aggregates the number of employees by country (United States, Asia, Canada) without using joins.
Approach:
Treat the previously generated transposed data as a source and count the number of employees per region.
Aggregate these counts to get the totals for each country.
Solution: The query sums the counts for specific region IDs associated with each country, effectively giving the total number of employees in the United States, Asia, and Canada.


Understanding Subqueries:

A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It's used to perform more complex filtering or calculation operations in SQL.
What is a Correlated Subquery?:

A correlated subquery is different from a regular subquery because it refers to a column from the outer query, creating a dependency between the inner and outer queries.
The correlated subquery is executed repeatedly, once for each row processed by the outer query.
Example of a Regular Subquery:

The instructor shows an example where a subquery is used to filter employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of all employees.
This is a regular subquery, not correlated, because it doesn't depend on any columns from the outer query.
Example of a Correlated Subquery:

To demonstrate a correlated subquery, the instructor writes a query to find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary within their department.
The subquery is correlated because it compares each employee’s department in the outer query to the departments in the inner query.
Performance Considerations:

Correlated subqueries can be slow because the inner query must be executed for every row processed by the outer query. This can be a performance issue with large datasets.
Assignment 1 - Counting Departments with More than 38 Employees:

Task: Write a query to find the names of departments with more than 38 employees using a correlated subquery.
Solution: The query uses a correlated subquery in the WHERE clause to count the number of employees in each department and then filter those departments that exceed 38 employees.
Assignment 2 - Finding the Highest Salary in Departments with More than 38 Employees:

Task: Extend the previous query to include the highest salary in each of those departments.
Solution: The query uses another correlated subquery to find the maximum salary for each department and include it in the results.


Problem Overview:
You are tasked with generating a report that shows:

Department: The department name.
Employee First Name: The name of the employee.
Salary: The salary of the employee.
Flag: A flag indicating whether the salary is the highest or the lowest in that department.
Steps to Solve the Problem:
Initial Thoughts:

The first instinct might be to use a GROUP BY clause to group the data by department and then calculate the maximum and minimum salaries. However, this approach does not allow you to include the employee's name directly because it would require grouping by the employee's name, which defeats the purpose.
Correlated Subquery:

The solution involves using correlated subqueries to fetch the maximum and minimum salaries for each department while also retrieving the associated employee's name and salary.
Query Breakdown:

Step 1: Select the department, first_name, and salary from the employees table.
Step 2: Use a correlated subquery to calculate the max_salary for each department.
Step 3: Use a correlated subquery to calculate the min_salary for each department.
Step 4: Use a CASE statement to flag each record as either "Highest Salary" or "Lowest Salary" based on the salary matching the max_salary or min_salary.
Final Query:

The final query combines all the above steps into a single SQL statement that produces the desired report.
SQL Query Example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    department,
    first_name,
    salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary = max_by_department THEN 'Highest Salary'
        WHEN salary = min_by_department THEN 'Lowest Salary'
    END AS salary_in_department
FROM (
    SELECT 
        e1.department,
        e1.first_name,
        e1.salary,
        (SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
         FROM employees e2
         WHERE e2.department = e1.department) AS max_by_department,
        (SELECT MIN(e2.salary)
         FROM employees e2
         WHERE e2.department = e1.department) AS min_by_department
    FROM employees e1
) a
WHERE salary IN (max_by_department, min_by_department)
ORDER BY department, salary_in_department DESC;
Key Concepts:
Correlated Subqueries: These subqueries depend on the outer query for their values, making them run repeatedly for each row in the outer query.
CASE Clause: Used here to create a flag that indicates whether the salary is the highest or lowest in the department.



Introduction to Joins:

Joins link data from two or more tables based on a common column.
Similar to correlated subqueries but can join multiple tables.
Example of Basic Join:

Joined employees and regions tables on region_id.
Selected employee's first name and the country they work in.
Exercise 1:

Task: Create a report showing employee's first name, email, and division, excluding null emails.
Solution:
Join employees and departments tables on department.
Use WHERE email IS NOT NULL to filter out null emails.
Use table prefixes or aliases to avoid column name ambiguity.
Expanding to Multiple Tables:

Added regions table to include the country in the report.
Demonstrated how to join three tables and select specific columns.
Using Aliases:

Simplifies queries by shortening table names.
Essential when columns have the same name in different tables.
Exercise 2:

Task: Count the number of employees in each country.
Solution:
Join employees and regions on region_id.
Use GROUP BY clause to count employees per country.
Subqueries as Data Sources:

Subqueries can act as sources of data similar to tables.
Differentiation between correlated and non-correlated subqueries.



Here’s a bullet-point summary of the lecture on INNER and OUTER Joins:

Introduction to Join Syntax:

Joins can be specified in the WHERE clause or using the INNER JOIN syntax.
INNER JOIN syntax reads more naturally and is consistent across databases.
INNER JOIN:

Joins tables based on matching values in specified columns.
Example: employees and regions tables joined on region_id to retrieve employee first name and country.
Can join multiple tables by adding more INNER JOIN clauses.
Adding Additional Joins:

Example of joining employees, departments, and regions tables.
Emphasizes that each additional INNER JOIN connects to the result set of previous joins.
INNER JOIN Behavior:

Only returns rows where there are matching values in both joined tables.
OUTER JOIN Introduction:

LEFT JOIN:
Returns all rows from the left table (e.g., employees) and matching rows from the right table (departments).
Non-matching rows from the right table result in NULL values.
RIGHT JOIN:
Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
Non-matching rows from the left table result in NULL values.
Example with LEFT JOIN:

Demonstrated how LEFT JOIN reveals rows in the employees table that do not have corresponding entries in the departments table.
RIGHT JOIN Example:

Showed how RIGHT JOIN gives preference to the right table (departments) and returns all rows from it.
Assignment:

Task: Identify departments that exist in employees but not in departments.
Solution: Use LEFT JOIN and filter NULL values from the departments table.
FULL OUTER JOIN:

Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.
Non-matching rows from either side result in NULL values.
Practice Suggestions:

Encouragement to practice LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to understand their behavior.
Key Points:

LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN are also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
FULL OUTER JOIN exposes all non-matching data from both tables.
INNER JOIN focuses only on matching data.



Introduction to Working with Multiple Tables:

Aside from joins, you can use UNION, UNION ALL, and EXCEPT to work with multiple tables.
UNION:

Stacks data from two queries on top of each other.
Removes duplicates, showing only unique rows.
Example: Combine departments from employees and departments tables, resulting in 28 unique departments.
UNION ALL:

Similar to UNION, but does not remove duplicates.
Stacks all rows from both queries, including duplicates.
Example: Combining 27 records from employees and 24 from departments, resulting in 51 records.
Key Rules for UNION and UNION ALL:

Both queries must have the same number of columns.
Data types in corresponding columns must match.
The ORDER BY clause must be placed at the end of the entire query.
EXCEPT Clause:

Returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.
Similar to subtraction in set theory.
Example: Finding departments in employees that do not exist in departments, and vice versa.
Practical Assignment:

Task: Create a report showing the department name and total number of employees, with a final row showing the total count of employees across all departments.
Solution: Use GROUP BY to count employees per department, then UNION ALL to add the total count at the end.



ntroduction to Cartesian Products:

A Cartesian product occurs when every row from one table is combined with every row from another table.
This happens when there is no explicit join condition between the tables.
Example of Cartesian Product:

Query: SELECT * FROM employees, departments;
Each row from employees is combined with each row from departments, resulting in a large number of rows (e.g., 24,000 rows if there are 1,000 employees and 24 departments).
Explaining the Concept:

Without a join condition, SQL returns all possible combinations of rows, leading to a Cartesian product.
The number of rows in the result is the product of the number of rows in each table.
Alias Usage in Cartesian Products:

If the same table is referenced twice in a query, aliases are necessary to distinguish them.
Example: SELECT * FROM employees A, employees B; returns every combination of employees with each other, resulting in a larger Cartesian product.
Explicit Cartesian Products with CROSS JOIN:

CROSS JOIN explicitly specifies that you want a Cartesian product.
Example: SELECT * FROM employees CROSS JOIN departments; results in the same output as without a join, combining every employee with every department.
Practical Use of Cartesian Products:

While usually undesirable, there are cases where a Cartesian product might be needed.
The CROSS JOIN is a more explicit and clear way to indicate this need.
Conclusion:

Cartesian products multiply the rows of tables together, often resulting in large datasets.
Understanding and using CROSS JOIN can be important in scenarios where all combinations of data are needed.
Note:

Cartesian products can result in very large datasets, so they should be used with caution.


Here’s a bullet-point summary of the lecture on exercises related to Joins and Subqueries:

Objective:

Practice using Joins and Subqueries with real-world scenarios.
Exercise 1:

Task: Write a query to return the first name, department, hire date, and country of the first and last employees hired in the company.
Approach:
Use MIN(hire_date) to find the first hire and MAX(hire_date) to find the last hire.
Use INNER JOIN to connect employees and regions tables for country information.
Combine results using UNION ALL to display both the first and last hires.
Exercise 2:

Task: Create a report showing the salary budget fluctuation for every 90-day period.
Approach:
Use a GROUP BY clause to group data by a 90-day range, starting from the first hire date.
Utilize date arithmetic (e.g., hire_date - 90) to define the range.
Implement a correlated subquery to sum salaries within the specified 90-day period.
Order the results by hire_date to visualize the salary spending pattern over time.
Key Concepts:

Correlated Subqueries:

Subquery runs for each row of the outer query, making use of its data.
Essential for calculating values like salary sums within moving ranges.
Date Arithmetic:

Use date operations like date - 90 or date + 90 to define time ranges for grouping data.
UNION vs. UNION ALL:

UNION eliminates duplicates, while UNION ALL retains all rows.
Takeaways:

Practice and repetition are crucial for mastering SQL queries, especially when working with complex subqueries and moving ranges.
Understanding the correlation between outer and inner queries is key to writing effective SQL.


Introduction to Views:

A view is a virtual table generated by a SQL query.
Views make querying easier by encapsulating complex queries.
Unlike tables, you cannot insert, delete, or update data directly in a view.
Creating a View:

Example: A view combining data from employees, departments, and regions tables to show employee information (e.g., first name, department, country).
Syntax to create a view:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS [query];
The created view can be queried like a table: SELECT * FROM view_name;
Views are saved in the database and can be reused without rewriting the underlying query.
Benefits of Views:

Simplify complex queries by saving them as views.
Reuse saved queries without having to remember or rewrite the join conditions.
Views can be used in other queries, including joins with other tables or views.
Inline Views:

An inline view is a subquery used in the FROM clause of a SQL statement.
Example: SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM departments) AS dept;
Inline views are temporary and exist only for the duration of the query.
They provide flexibility in writing queries by allowing you to treat the result of a subquery as a table.
Differences Between Views and Inline Views:

Views:
Stored in the database.
Reusable across multiple queries.
Acts as a persistent object in the database, similar to tables.
Inline Views:
Not stored in the database.
Used within a single query.
Acts as a temporary table only during the execution of the query.
Utility of Views:

Enhance query efficiency and readability.
Useful for repeated queries or when working with complex data relationships.


ntroduction to Window Functions:

Window functions, also known as analytical functions, allow advanced data slicing and aggregation.
They provide more flexibility than traditional GROUP BY clauses.
Review of GROUP BY:

GROUP BY is used to aggregate data, like counting employees in each department.
Combining non-aggregated columns with aggregated ones can be complex and requires subqueries.
Simplification with Window Functions:

The OVER() clause allows combining non-aggregated and aggregated columns without needing GROUP BY.
Example: COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY department) gives the count of employees per department while displaying individual employee details.
Using PARTITION BY:

The PARTITION BY clause within the OVER() function divides the result set into partitions (e.g., by department or region).
Aggregations are performed within these partitions, enabling detailed analysis.
Efficiency and Comparison:

Window functions are more efficient and simpler than correlated subqueries.
They reduce the need for complex and resource-intensive queries.
Examples of Window Functions:

Demonstrations include using SUM, COUNT, and AVG with the OVER() clause.
The results can be analyzed for different partitions, such as departments or regions.
Encouragement to Practice:

Practice with various window functions to understand their power in data analysis.
Mastering these functions is essential before progressing to further exercises in the course.


Introduction to Window Framing:

A window is a data set on which an aggregation is computed.
The window can change based on partitions, like department or region.
Running Total Example:

A running total adds each salary to the previous one to show how the total salary budget increases over time.
Example query: SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date).
Using the OVER() Clause with ORDER BY:

The ORDER BY clause structures data in a specific order (e.g., by hire date).
A running total is computed by summing values in the ordered window.
Introduction to the RANGE Clause:

The RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW clause defines the data range for the aggregation.
This computes the sum of all preceding rows up to the current row.
Default Behavior of Window Functions:

By default, window functions consider all preceding rows up to the current row.
No need to explicitly define RANGE unless a specific behavior is required.
Partitioning with Window Functions:

The PARTITION BY clause divides data into groups (e.g., by department).
Each partition has its own running total or other aggregations.
Computing Adjacent Rows with ROWS BETWEEN:

The ROWS BETWEEN clause allows summing or averaging adjacent rows.
Example: ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW sums the current row and the row before it.
Practical Examples:

Examples include summing salaries of adjacent rows or computing totals for larger groups.
Adjusting the number of preceding rows in the window frame changes the result.
Importance of Practice:

The lecture emphasizes the need to practice window functions and understand their powerful capabilities.
Conclusion:

The ORDER BY and PARTITION BY clauses in the OVER() function allow for complex data analysis.
Mastery of these concepts enables efficient and advanced SQL querying.



Introduction to Window Functions:

The lecture covers additional window functions: RANK, NTILE, FIRST_VALUE, and NTH_VALUE.
RANK Function:

Used to rank data based on a specific criterion.
Example: Ranking employees by salary within their departments.
The rank resets for each partition, such as by department.
Using RANK in a Subquery:

To filter specific ranks (e.g., employees in the 8th position by salary), use a subquery with a WHERE clause.
Direct filtering with WHERE on the RANK column isn’t possible because it's processed after the WHERE clause.
NTILE Function:

Divides rows into a specified number of buckets (e.g., salary brackets).
Example: Splitting each department into five salary brackets.
FIRST_VALUE Function:

Returns the first value in a sorted set of rows within a partition.
Example: Displaying the highest salary in a department for all employees in that department.
Comparison of FIRST_VALUE and MAX:

Both can show the first/highest value, but FIRST_VALUE allows for more flexible ordering (e.g., by first name).
NTH_VALUE Function:

Retrieves the nth value in a sorted set within a partition.
Example: Getting the 5th highest salary in each department.
Practical Applications:

Use RANK for ranking data, NTILE for creating groups/buckets, FIRST_VALUE for displaying the first value, and NTH_VALUE for specific nth values.
Encouragement for Practice:

The lecture encourages practicing these functions to understand their utility in various scenarios.
Engagement with Audience:

The instructor invites students to share ideas on using the NTH_VALUE function in the comments section.



Introduction to LEAD and LAG Functions:

These functions allow you to access data from a row that is relative to the current row, either from a previous or a next row.
LEAD Function:

Retrieves the value from the row immediately following the current row.
Example: Display the salary from the next row in a column called "Next Salary".
If it's the last row, the "Next Salary" will be NULL since there is no next row.
LAG Function:

Retrieves the value from the row immediately preceding the current row.
Example: Display the salary from the previous row in a column called "Previous Salary".
If it's the first row, the "Previous Salary" will be NULL since there is no previous row.
Use Case Example:

Determine the closest higher salary for each employee:
Use LAG function to get the salary from the previous row after sorting by salary in descending order.
Determine the closest lower salary for each employee:
Use LEAD function to get the salary from the next row after sorting by salary in descending order.
Partitioning with LEAD and LAG:

You can partition the data by a specific column, such as department, to apply LEAD or LAG within each partition.
Example: Partition by department to find the closest lower salary within each department.
Practical Application:

The lecture demonstrates sorting employees by salary within each department and using LEAD and LAG to find the next higher or lower salary for comparison.
The lowest paid employee in each department will have NULL for the "Closest Lower Salary" because there’s no lower salary.
Conclusion:

The LEAD and LAG functions are useful for comparing data points within a dataset, particularly when looking at sequential data or needing to reference adjacent rows.



Introduction to Rollups and Cubes:

Rollups and cubes are operations that work with the GROUP BY clause in SQL to provide flexibility in data analysis.
Setting Up the Data:

A simple sales table is created with columns: continent, country, city, and units sold.
The data includes multiple cities within countries, and countries within continents.
Basic GROUP BY Examples:

Group by continent, country, and city separately to get the sum of units sold.
These separate queries show how many units were sold by continent, by country, and by city.
Grouping Sets:

The GROUP BY clause can use GROUPING SETS to display the breakdown by continent, country, and city in one query.
Example:
The query shows sums by continent, by country, and by city all together.
This eliminates the need for multiple queries.
Adding a Grand Total:

By adding an empty set of brackets to the GROUPING SETS, you can include a grand total of units sold.
This shows the overall total as well as the breakdown by continent, country, and city.
Using ROLLUP:

The ROLLUP operation provides the sum of units sold for combinations of columns.
It gives totals by grouping all three columns (continent, country, city), then by grouping two columns (continent, country), and finally by grouping one column (continent).
The result includes the grand total by default.
Using CUBE:

The CUBE operation provides all possible combinations of grouping the columns.
It includes sums by grouping each individual column, as well as combinations of two columns, and all three columns together.
CUBE is more comprehensive than ROLLUP, showing every possible grouping combination.
Comparison of ROLLUP and CUBE:

ROLLUP gives a hierarchical summary (all columns, then pairs, then single columns).
CUBE gives a full summary with every possible combination of grouping.
Practical Usage:

Rollups and cubes allow for more flexible and comprehensive data analysis, reducing the need for multiple queries.
Conclusion:

Practice with ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS using the provided data to understand how these operations change the way data is grouped and aggregated in SQL.



SQL Aggregation: Using functions like MAX() and MIN() within subqueries to find specific values within grouped data.
SUM: Sums up numeric values in a column (e.g., total salaries paid).
